# **Web scraping and data cleaning with Beautiful Soup and Pandas**
In this project, Beautiful Soup was used to scrape data from a wikipedia article about the top companies by revenue in the US. The extracted data was then placed into a pandas dataframe for cleaning.

## Web scraping process
* Obtaining the html code of the article
* Using Beautiful Soup to work with the code as a text
* Finding the table of interest in the code
* Extract the information from each of the columns
* Inserting the information into a pandas dataframe

## Data cleaning process:
* Manipulating and transforming string values into a numerical category when appropriate
* Splitting columns with more than one value in them
* Renaming columns for clarity
